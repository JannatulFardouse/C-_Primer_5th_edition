    To test the program from Exercise 1.23 by giving multiple transactions representing multiple ISBNs, 
    we can input a series of transactions with various ISBNs. The program will count and group the records for each unique ISBN together. 
    Here's an example of how you can test the program:

                Enter transactions in the format (ISBN units-sold price), separated by spaces:
                978-034537570,3,20.00
                978-0553380958,2,25.00
                978-034537570,1,20.00
                978-0312991462,4,15.00
                978-0312956635,2,18.00
                978-0553380958,3,25.00
    In this example, we are entering multiple transactions with different ISBNs. 
    The program will group the records for each unique ISBN together and count how many times each ISBN appears.

    The expected output might look something like this:
                ISBN: 978-0312956635 Count: 1
                ISBN: 978-0312991462 Count: 1
                ISBN: 978-034537570 Count: 2
                ISBN: 978-0553380958 Count: 2

    The program groups the records for each unique ISBN and displays the counts accordingly.
    It's essential to ensure that the ISBNs are correctly formatted and that the transactions are provided in the specified format
    (ISBN, units sold, price) for the program to work correctly.
