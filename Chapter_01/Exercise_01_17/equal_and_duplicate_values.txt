Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal?
What if there are no duplicated values?

//Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

In the program this section provided, which counts how many consecutive times each distinct value appears in the input,
the behavior will be as follows based on the input:

If the input values are all equal:

            If all the input values are equal, let's say all are 42, 
            then the program will correctly count how many times the value 42 appears consecutively.
            The output will show that 42 occurs 11 times (assuming there are 11 consecutive 42s).

If there are no duplicated values:

            If there are no duplicated values and each value in the input is unique, the program will still work correctly.
            It will print the count of each distinct value in the order they appear in the input.
            For example, if the input is 1 2 3 4 5, the program will output:
                                            1 occurs 1 times
                                            2 occurs 1 times
                                            3 occurs 1 times
                                            4 occurs 1 times
                                            5 occurs 1 times
The program is designed to handle both scenarios, whether there are repeated values or not. 
It counts the consecutive occurrences of each distinct value and reports the count for each distinct value encountered in the input.
