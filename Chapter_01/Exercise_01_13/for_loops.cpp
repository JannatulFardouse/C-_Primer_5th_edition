/*--
Exercise 1.13: Rewrite the first two exercises from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 13) using for loops.
pg.13:the first two exercises are:
        Exercise 1.9: Write a program that uses a while to sum the numbers from 50 to 100.
        Exercise 1.10: In addition to the ++ operator that adds 1 to its operand, there is a
        decrement operator (--) that subtracts 1. Use the decrement operator to write a while
        that prints the numbers from ten down to zero.

    //print down values from 10 to 0
