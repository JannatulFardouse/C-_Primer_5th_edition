 Exercise 1.6: Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
<< " and " << v2;
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How
would you fix it?

 // Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

The given fragment is i 3 line code and they are :
line 1 is : 
    std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
line 2 : 
     << " and " << v2;
line 3:
    << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

The following fragment is not legal becasue, the left shift arrow or the token cannot be used without a primary expression.
So, line 1 is correct where as line 2 and 3 need to add std::cout expression before "<<" left shift arrow.

A legal or correct way could be wriiten as following code: 

        std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
        std::cout << " and " << v2;
        std::cout << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
