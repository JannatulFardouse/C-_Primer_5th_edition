values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no number is repeated

//Solution By Jannatul Fardouse

Exercise 1.18 requires to compile and run the program from the provided section,
first with equal values as input and then with values in which no number is repeated.
Let's see how the program behaves in both scenarios:

Scenario 1: Equal Values as Input:

        If we provide equal values as input,
        such as all "42," the program will count the consecutive occurrences of that value.
        The program should correctly report the count for the equal values. For example:
                                $ ./jannatul_program
                                42 42 42 42 42 42

                                Output:
                                42 occurs 6 times

Scenario 2: No Repeated Values as Input:

        If we provide values in which no number is repeated and each value is unique,
        such as "1 2 3 4 5," the program will still work correctly.
        It will report the count for each distinct value in the order they appear. For example:

                                $ ./Jannatul_program
                                1 2 3 4 5

                                Output:
                                1 occurs 1 times
                                2 occurs 1 times
                                3 occurs 1 times
                                4 occurs 1 times
                                5 occurs 1 times

The program is designed to handle both scenarios, and it will function as expected in each case,
counting and reporting the occurrences of the values provided in the input.
