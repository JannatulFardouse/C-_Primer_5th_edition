  Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a
while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

/***** For Loops *****/

Advantages:
  1. Explicit control: Perfect for scenarios where you know the number of iterations beforehand.
     The loop control variables are initialized, tested, and updated within the loop structure.
  2. Ideal for counting: Well-suited for iterating over a range or sequence of known length.

Disadvantages:
    Complexity: The initialization, condition, and update expressions within the loop header can sometimes make the loop structure more complex.

/***** While Loops *****/

Advantages:
  1. Simplicity: Simple and concise, especially when the loop condition is dynamic or not bound by a specific number of iterations.
  2. Dynamic conditions: Great for scenarios where the loop termination is based on user input or unpredictable conditions.

Disadvantages:
   Potential infinite loops: It's easier to create infinite loops accidentally, especially if the condition is not properly controlled or updated within the loop.

In summary, the for loop is advantageous when you need precise control over loop variables and a specific number of iterations.
On the other hand, the while loop is advantageous for its simplicity and adaptability to dynamic conditions, 
but it requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops.
