// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's break down each literal:

                (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"

    This string literal represents the following text: "Who goes with Fergus?" followed by a newline character '\n'.
    The escape sequences are interpreted:
    '\145' represents the octal value 145, which is the ASCII code for the lowercase 'e'.
    '\012' represents the octal value 12, which is the ASCII code for the newline character '\n'.
    Type: Array of 'const char'.

                (b) 3.14e1L

    This floating-point literal represents the value of 3.14Ã—10^1, which is 31.4
    Type: 'long double'.

                (c) 1024f

    This floating-point literal represents the value of 1024 as a float.
    Type: 'float'.

                (d) 3.14L

    This floating-point literal represents the value of 3.14 as a long double.
    Type: 'long double'.

    In summary:

                (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012" is a string literal.
                (b) 3.14e1L is a long double literal.
                (c) 1024f is a float literal.
                (d) 3.14L is a long double literal.
