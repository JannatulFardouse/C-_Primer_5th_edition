/*
    Exercise 2.23: Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object?
    If so, how? If not, why not?

*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    The validity of whether a pointer p points to a valid object cannot be reliably determined, especially when it is uninitialized. 
    In most compilers, when an uninitialized pointer is used, the bits present at the memory location associated with p are treated as 
    an address. This behavior is undefined, emphasizing the importance of initializing pointers before use to ensure predictable and 
    safe behavior.
