// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    In C++, the initial values of variables depend on their storage duration and type:

        global_str (global variable of type std::string):
    
            The default constructor of std::string will be called, initializing global_str to an empty string.
    
        global_int (global variable of type int):
    
            It will be initialized to zero because it has static storage duration.
    
        local_int (local variable of type int inside main() function):
    
            Its initial value is indeterminate (undefined). Local variables without explicit initialization have unpredictable values.
    
        local_str (local variable of type std::string inside main() function):
    
            The default constructor of std::string will be called, initializing local_str to an empty string.
    
    To summarize:

        global_str: Empty string.
        global_int: Zero.
        local_int: Undefined (garbage value).
        local_str: Empty string.
