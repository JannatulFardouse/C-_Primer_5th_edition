    Exercise 2.40: Write your own version of the Sales_data class.

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Here's a basic version of the 'Sales_data' class:

                #include <iostream>
                #include <string>

                struct Sales_data {
                    std::string bookNo;
                    unsigned unitsSold = 0;
                    double revenue = 0.0;
                };

    This simple 'Sales_data' class includes three members: 'bookNo' to store the book number or identifier,
    'unitsSold' to store the number of units sold, 
    and 'revenue' to store the total revenue. 
    The 'unitsSold' and 'revenue' members are initialized to '0' and '0.0', respectively.

    Feel free to enhance or modify this class based on your specific requirements or the features you want to include.
