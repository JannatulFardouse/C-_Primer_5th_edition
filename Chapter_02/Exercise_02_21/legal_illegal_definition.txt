    Let's analyze each definition:

        (a) double* dp = &i;
        This is legal but potentially problematic.
        It declares a pointer to a double ('dp') and initializes it with the address of an integer variable ('i').
        While the compiler allows it, it can lead to issues because it's generally not safe to treat the address of an 'int' 
        as the address of a 'double'.

        (b) int *ip = i;
        This is illegal. It attempts to initialize a pointer to an integer ('ip') with the value of an integer ('i'). 
        To correct it, the right-hand side should be the address of 'i': 'int *ip = &i;'.

        (c) int *p = &i;
        This is legal. It declares a pointer to an integer ('p') and initializes it with the address of an integer variable ('i').
