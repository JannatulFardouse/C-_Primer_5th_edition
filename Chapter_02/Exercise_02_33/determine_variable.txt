    Exercise 2.33: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens in each of these assignments:
                
                a = 42; b = 42; c = 42;
                d = 42; e = 42; g = 42;

*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's analyze the assignments based on this section:

                a = 42; // The type of 'a' is deduced from the initializer, which is int. 'a' becomes an int.
                b = 42; // The type of 'b' is deduced from the initializer, which is int. 'b' becomes an int.
                c = 42; // The type of 'c' is deduced from the initializer, which is int. 'c' becomes an int.
                d = 42; // The type of 'd' is deduced from the initializer, which is int. 'd' becomes an int.
                e = 42; // The type of 'e' is deduced from the initializer, which is int. 'e' becomes an int.
                g = 42; // The type of 'g' is deduced from the initializer, which is int. 'g' becomes an int.

    In summary, each variable ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'g') is assigned the value '42', and their types are deduced as 'int'.
