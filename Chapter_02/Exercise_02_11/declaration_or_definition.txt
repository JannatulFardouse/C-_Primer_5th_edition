    Exercise 2.11: Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:
            (a) extern int ix = 1024;
            (b) int iy;
            (c) extern int iz;

*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    (a) extern int ix = 1024;
    This is a definition.
    It declares an "extern" integar variable 'ix' and initializes it with the value '1024'.
    The "extern" keyword is typecally used for declaration, but in this context, it also provides a definition with an initializer.

    (b) int iy;
    This is a definition.
    It declares an integar variable 'iy' without providing an explicit initializer.
    The variable is defined and allocated storage, and its initial value is undefined (garbage value).

    (c) extern int iz;
    This is a declaration.
    It declares an extern integer variable 'iz' without providing an initializer.
    The extern keyword indicates that the variable is declared, 
    and its definition is expected to be provided elsewhere (possibly in another translation unit).


    In summary:
        (a) Definition.
        (b) Definition.
        (c) Declaration.
