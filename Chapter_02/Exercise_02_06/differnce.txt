    Exercise 2.6: What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:
            int month = 9, day = 7;
            int month = 09, day = 07;
--*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    The differences between the two definitions are related to the number representations used:

                    int month = 9, day = 7;

    In this case, 9 and 7 are decimal (base 10) integers.
    The leading zeros are not used, as integers in C++ are typically written in decimal format.
    The values assigned to month and day are 9 and 7, respectively.

                    int month = 09, day = 07;

    In this case, 09 and 07 are treated as octal (base 8) integers because of the leading zeros.
    In octal notation, valid digits are 0 to 7.
    However, the use of '9' in octal is not valid. So, the compiler will likely produce an error.

    To correct the second definition, we should use valid octal digits:


                    int month = 011;  // octal 11 is decimal 9
                    int day = 07;     // octal 7 is decimal 7
                    
    So, the corrected version ensures that valid octal representations are used, and month is assigned the decimal value 9.
