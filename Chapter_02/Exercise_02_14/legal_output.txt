  Exercise 2.14: Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?
        int i = 100, sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        sum += i;
        std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;

     Yes, the program is legal. It uses two different scopes for the variable 'i':

                int i = 100, sum = 0;                        // This is the global variable i
                for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)                // This is a local variable i within the for loop scope
                    sum += i;
                std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;  // Print the global i and the sum

    In the loop, a local variable 'i' is used, which is distinct from the global variable 'i'. 
    The loop runs from '0' to '9', accumulating the values in the local variable 'sum'. After the loop, it prints the global 'i' (which is 100) 
    and the 'sum' (which is 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45).
    
    So, the output of the program will be: 100 45
