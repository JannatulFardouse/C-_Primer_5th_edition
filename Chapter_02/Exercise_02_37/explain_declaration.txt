/*
    Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type.
    The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then
    the type of the expression i=x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type
    and value of each variable in this code:
                int a = 3, b = 4;
                decltype(a) c = a;
                decltype(a = b) d = a;

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's analyze the code:

                int a = 3, b = 4;
                decltype(a) c = a;
                decltype(a = b) d = a;

            'decltype(a) c = a;': The type of 'c' is 'int', and its value is '3'.
            'decltype(a = b) d = a;': The type of 'd' is 'int&' because assignment expressions yield a reference type. 
            Its value is '3' since 'a' was assigned the value of 'b' in the expression.

    So, after the code finishes:

                The value of 'a' remains '3'.
                The value of 'b' is '4'.
                The value of 'c' is '3'.
                The value of 'd' is '3'.
