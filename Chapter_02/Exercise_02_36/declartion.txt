    Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:
                int a = 3, b = 4;
                decltype(a) c = a;
                decltype((b)) d = a;
                ++c;
                ++d;
*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's analyze the code:

                int a = 3, b = 4;
                decltype(a) c = a;
                decltype((b)) d = a;
                ++c;
                ++d;

        'decltype(a) c = a;': The type of 'c' is 'int', and its value becomes '4' after '++c;'.
        
        'decltype((b)) d = a;': The type of 'd' is 'int&' (reference to 'int'), and its value becomes '4' after '++d;' 
        because it is essentially a reference to 'a'.
   
    After the code finishes:

                The value of 'a' remains '3'.
                The value of 'b' remains '4'.
                The value of 'c' becomes '4'.
                The value of 'd' becomes '4'.
