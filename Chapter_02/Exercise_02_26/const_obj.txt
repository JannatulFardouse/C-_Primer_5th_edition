    Exercise 2.26: Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal, explain why.

        (a) const int buf;          (b) int cnt = 0;
        (c) const int sz = cnt;     (d) ++cnt; ++sz;

*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's analyze each statement:

        (a) const int buf;
        Illegal. A 'const' variable must be initialized at the time of declaration. Here, 'buf' is declared as 'const' but not initialized.

        (b) int cnt = 0;
        Legal. 'cnt' is declared as an integer and initialized with the value '0'.

        (c) const int sz = cnt;
        Legal. 'sz' is declared as a 'const' integer and initialized with the value of 'cnt'.

        (d) ++cnt; ++sz;
        Legal for '++cnt' but illegal for '++sz'. 'sz' is declared as a 'const' variable, 
        which means its value cannot be modified after initialization. 
        Attempting to increment 'sz' will result in a compilation error.

        Corrected version of (a):
                    const int buf = 0; // Legal, initializing const variable

        Corrected summary:+

                    (a) const int buf = 0;
                    (b) int cnt = 0;
                    (c) const int sz = cnt;
                    (d) ++cnt; // Legal / ++sz; // Illegal
