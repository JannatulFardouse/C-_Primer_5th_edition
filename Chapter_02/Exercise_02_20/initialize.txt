    Exercise 2.20: What does the following program do?
                int i = 42;
                int *p1 = &i;
                *p1 = *p1 * *p1;

*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's break down the provided code:

        1. int i = 42;: Declares an integer variable 'i' and initializes it with the value '42'.
        
        2. int *p1 = &i;: Declares a pointer to an integer 'p1' and initializes it with the address of 'i'.
        
        3. *p1 = *p1 * *p1;: Dereferences 'p1', retrieves the value stored at the address it points to (which is the value of 'i'),
             multiplies it by itself, and assigns the result back to the memory location pointed to by 'p1' (which is 'i').

    After this code segment, the value of 'i' is modified. 
    The final value of 'i' is the result of squaring its original value ('42 * 42 = 1764').
    The pointer 'p1' is used to indirectly modify the value of 'i' through its memory address.

    So, after this code segment, the value of 'i' will be '1764'.
