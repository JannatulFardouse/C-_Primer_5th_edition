// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's analyze each assignment:

        (a) i = ic;
        Legal. Copies the value of the constant integer 'ic' into the non-const integer 'i'.
        
        (b) p1 = p3;
        Illegal. 'p3' is a pointer to a constant integer, and 'p1' is a pointer to a non-const integer.
        Assigning a pointer to a constant integer to a pointer to a non-const integer is not allowed.
        
        (c) p1 = &ic;
        Illegal. 'ic' is a constant integer, and 'p1' is a pointer to a non-const integer.
        Assigning the address of a constant integer to a pointer to a non-const integer is not allowed.
        
        (d) p3 = &ic;
        Illegal. 'p3' is a constant pointer to a constant integer, and we cannot change the address it holds.
        
        (e) p2 = p1;
        Illegal. 'p2' is a constant pointer, and 'p1' is a pointer to a non-const integer.
        Assigning a non-constant pointer to a constant pointer is not allowed.
        
        (f) ic = *p3;
        Illegal. 'ic' is a constant integer, and we cannot modify its value.

    Corrected summary:
                (a) Legal
                (b) Illegal
                (c) Illegal
                (d) Illegal
                (e) Illegal
                (f) Illegal
