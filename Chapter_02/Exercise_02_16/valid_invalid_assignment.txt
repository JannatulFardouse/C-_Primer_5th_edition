// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    (a) r2 = 3.14159;
        Valid. It assigns the value '3.14159' to the variable 'd' through the reference 'r2'.

    (b)r2 = r1;
        Valid. It assigns the value of 'i' to 'd' through the reference 'r2'. Since 'r1' is a reference to 'i',
        it copies the value of 'i' into 'd'.

    (c) i = r2;
        Valid. It assigns the value of 'd' to 'i'. The assignment copies the value from 'd' (through the reference 'r2') into 'i'.

    (d) r1 = d;
        Valid. It assigns the value of 'd' to 'i' through the reference 'r1'. Since 'r1' is a reference to 'i',
        it copies the value of 'd' into 'i'.

    In summary:

            (a) Assigns a double value to 'd' through the reference 'r2'.
            (b) Assigns the value of 'i' to 'd' through the reference 'r2'.
            (c) Assigns the value of 'd' to 'i'.
            (d) Assigns the value of 'd' to 'i' through the reference 'r1'.
