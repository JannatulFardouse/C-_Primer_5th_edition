//Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

To calculate a mortgage payment, we would typically use the following data types for the rate, principal, and payment:

Rate (Interest Rate):

The interest rate is typically represented as a decimal or percentage, and it may have fractional parts. 
For representing interest rates, you should use a data type that can handle decimal numbers with precision. 
The most appropriate data type for the interest rate is double. Using a floating-point type like double allows us to represent rates 
like 4.25% accurately (as 0.0425) while still providing sufficient precision for calculations.

Example:

            double interestRate = 0.0425; // 4.25%

Principal (Loan Amount):

The principal amount is the initial loan amount borrowed and is typically represented as a positive numeric value. 
The principal is often expressed as a large whole number, and it should not have fractional parts. For representing the principal,
we can use an integer data type like long long to ensure it can handle large loan amounts.

Example:
            long long principalAmount = 200000; // $200,000

Payment (Monthly Payment):

The monthly payment is the amount to be paid each month, including both principal and interest. 
It can be a decimal value, and it's typically represented with two decimal places for precision. For representing the payment amount, 
we should use the double data type to handle decimal values accurately.

Example:

            double monthlyPayment = 1500.75; // $1,500.75
Using double for the rate and payment ensures that we can accurately handle decimal values and precision, 
which is crucial for financial calculations like mortgage payments.

Using long long for the principal allows us to represent large loan amounts without losing precision due to integer truncation.
