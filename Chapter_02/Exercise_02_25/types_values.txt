    Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.
            (a) int* ip, i, &r = i; 
            (b) int i, *ip = 0; 
            (c) int* ip, ip2;

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's analyze each variable declaration:

        (a) int* ip, i, &r = i;
            'ip': Pointer to an integer ('int*').
            'i': Integer.
            'r': Reference to an integer (i'nt&'), initialized to reference 'i'.

        (b) int i, *ip = 0;
            'i': Integer.
            'ip': Pointer to an integer ('int*'), initialized to a null pointer ('0').

        (c) int* ip, ip2;
            'ip': Pointer to an integer ('int*').
            'ip2': Integer, not a pointer.

    Values:
    The values of the variables depend on their usage and initialization in the program.
    
    Example usage:

        int main() {
    int i = 5;
    int* ip = &i;   // ip points to the address of i
    int& r = i;     // r is a reference to i

    int* ip2 = nullptr; // ip2 is initialized as a null pointer

    // Usage of variables
    *ip = 10;   // i is now 10 through the pointer ip
    r = 7;      // i is now 7 through the reference r

    // ip2 does not point to any specific memory location (uninitialized)

    return 0;
    }

    Always remember that the values of variables can change during the execution of the program based on assignments and other operations.
