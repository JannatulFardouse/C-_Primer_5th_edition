// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

     There is a simple C++ program that declares variables and performs the assignments as in Exercise 2.33.
     It then prints the variables before and after the assignments:
    
                 #include <iostream>

                int main() {
                    int a, b, c, d, e, g;

                    // Print variables before assignments
                    std::cout << "Before Assignments:" << std::endl;
                    std::cout << "a: " << a << "  b: " << b << "  c: " << c << std::endl;
                    std::cout << "d: " << d << "  e: " << e << "  g: " << g << std::endl;

                    // Perform assignments
                    a = 42;
                    b = 42;
                    c = 42;
                    d = 42;
                    e = 42;
                    g = 42;

                    // Print variables after assignments
                    std::cout << "\nAfter Assignments:" << std::endl;
                    std::cout << "a: " << a << "  b: " << b << "  c: " << c << std::endl;
                    std::cout << "d: " << d << "  e: " << e << "  g: " << g << std::endl;

                    return 0;
                }

    This program declares the variables, prints their initial values, performs the assignments, 
    and then prints their values after the assignments.
    We can run this program to verify the results and compare them with the predictions.
