    Exercise 2.12: Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
        (a) int double = 3.14; (b) int _;
        (c) int catch-22; (d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
        (e) double Double = 3.14;
*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

        (a) int double = 3.14;
        Invalid. 'double' is a reserved keyword in C++, and it cannot be used as an identifier.

        (b) int _;
        Valid. Identifiers beginning with an underscore are allowed.

        (c) int catch-22;
        Invalid. The hyphen in 'catch-22' makes it an invalid identifier. You cannot use hyphens in variable names.
    
        (d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
        Invalid. Variable names cannot start with a digit.
        
        (e) double Double = 3.14;
        Valid. The name 'Double' is a valid identifier.
        
        In summary:

                (a) Invalid ('double' is a reserved keyword).
                (b) Valid.
                (c) Invalid ('hyphen' is not allowed).
                (d) Invalid (starts with a digit).
                (e) Valid.
