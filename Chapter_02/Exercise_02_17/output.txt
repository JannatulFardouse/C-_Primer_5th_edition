    Exercise 2.17: What does the following code print?

            std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;
*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Let's break down the code:

                int i, &ri = i;
                i = 5; ri = 10;
                std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;

            int i, &ri = i;
            : Declares an integer 'i' and a reference 'ri' that refers to 'i'.

            i = 5;
            : Assigns the value '5' to 'i'.

            ri = 10;
            : Since 'ri' is a reference to 'i', this assignment sets the value of 'i' to '10'.

            std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;
            : Prints the values of 'i' and 'ri'.

    After the assignments, both 'i' and 'ri' have the value '10'. 
    
    So, the output of the program will be: 10 10
