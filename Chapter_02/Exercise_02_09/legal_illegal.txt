            (a) std::cin >> int input_value;

    This is illegal. It seems like an attempt to declare a variable named input_value of type int and use std::cin to read a value into it.
    However, the syntax is incorrect.
    To correct it, declare the variable separately:

                int input_value;
                std::cin >> input_value;

            (b) int i = { 3.14 };

    This is legal but with a narrowing conversion warning.
    It initializes an integer i with a floating-point value, which might lose information.
    To avoid the warning, use direct initialization:

                int i = 3.14;

            (c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;

    This is illegal because it is attempting to use an uninitialized variable wage to initialize salary.
    To correct it, declare and initialize wage separately:

                double wage = 9999.99;
                double salary = wage;

            (d) int i = 3.14;

    This is legal but with a narrowing conversion warning. It initializes an integer i with a floating-point value.
    To avoid the warning, use direct initialization:

                int i = 3.14;

    In summary:

            (a) Incorrect syntax for declaring and reading from std::cin.
            (b) Legal but with a narrowing conversion warning.
            (c) Illegal due to using an uninitialized variable for initialization.
            (d) Legal but with a narrowing conversion warning.
