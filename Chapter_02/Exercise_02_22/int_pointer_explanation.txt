    Exercise 2.22: Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:
                    if (p) // ...
                    if (*p) // ...
*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    Explanation:

            1. 'if (p)': This condition checks if the pointer 'p' is not a null pointer. If 'p' points to a valid memory location, 
        the condition evaluates to true, and the corresponding block is executed.

            2. 'if (*p)': This condition checks if the value pointed to by 'p' is not zero. If 'p' points to a valid memory location, 
        and the integer value at that location is non-zero, the condition evaluates to true, and the corresponding block is executed. 
        If 'p' is a null pointer or points to a memory location containing the value zero, the condition is false.
