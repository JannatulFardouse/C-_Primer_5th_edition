    Exercise 2.32: Is the following code legal or not? If not, how might you make it legal?
                    
                    int null = 0, *p = null;

*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse

    The given code is not legal because it tries to initialize a pointer ('p') with an integer ('null').
    To make it legal, you can initialize the pointer with a null pointer literal:

        int null = 0;
        int *p = nullptr;           // Legal: Initializing pointer with a null pointer literal

    Using 'nullptr' is the preferred way to initialize pointers to represent a null or undefined value.
