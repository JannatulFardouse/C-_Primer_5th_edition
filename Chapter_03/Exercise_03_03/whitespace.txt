/*
    Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the getline function.
*/

// Solution by Jannatul Fardouse


The string input operator (>>) in C++ skips leading whitespace 
and then reads characters until the next whitespace character is encountered.

The getline function reads a line of input until a newline character ('\n') is encountered, 
and it includes whitespace characters in the input.
